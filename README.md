# Win10LockScreenScraperScrapes all the great Windows Spotlight images used as lock screen images.# Usage## Running it ad-hoc    powershell C:\Path\To\Win10LockScreenScraper.ps1## Running automatically via the Task Scheduler### Creating the taskThe following command will schedule the script to run daily at 1 PM:    schtasks ^    /Create ^    /RU %YOUR_USERNAME% ^    /RP "*" ^    /SC DAILY ^    /TN Win10LockScreenScraper ^    /TR "powershell C:\Path\To\Win10LockScreenScraper.ps1" ^    /ST 13:00***Note:*** The argument for `/RP` (`"*"`) means that you'll be prompted for your password before the task is scheduled. This keeps you from having it in your history.### Deleting the task    schtasks /Delete /TN Win10LockScreenScraper# TODO- I've noticed that certain lock screen images contain metadata about the images (name, etc). We can base the filename off of that.- The destination directory is currently hardcoded. We should allow the user to configure that via an environment variable. # Why Powershell?Why not? It's already available on Windows 10. No need to install any other interpreters, runtimes, etc. Plus, I wanted to play around with it :)
